			Match rules<br />
The match will be ‚Äúbest of 3‚Äù 20 minute rounds in the ABBA format . The home team (A) will attack first and set a time for team B to try and beat in the second round on the same map. <br />
<br />
The game will be played 4v4 with each team having a minimum of 3 players on the server at the agreed time. If one team does not have 4 players than agreement must be sought from the opposition to play 3v4 or 3v3 if the team with a full compliment of players does not agree then this will be considered a no-show. If a team does not have the minimum number of players on the server within 20 minutes of the agreed start time this will be considered a no show.<br />
<br />
The Clan who made the challenge will be considered the home team (team A) and will also choose the first map. The away team choose the map for the second round which cannot be the same as the first.<br />
<br />
Scoring<br />
Scoring is determined as follows;<br />
Wining a full stopwatch round = 2 points, <br />
Full holds from both teams on a stopwatch round = 1 point each <br />
<br />
Draws are not possible, every match should have a winner.<br />
<br />
Weapons and class restrictions <br />
Weapons:<br />
MAX 1 Sniper Rifle/Rail Gun per team.<br />
NO mines allowed.<br />
NO airstrikes allowed.<br />
<br />
Deployables:<br />

<br />

Make sure the server runs the following settings:<br />
g_disableVehicleSpawns &quot;1&quot;<br />
killTransports<br />
<br />
Maplist:<br />
- Area22<br />
- Ark<br />
- Island<br />
- Quarry<br />
- Salvage<br />
- Sewer<br />
- Volcano<br />
<br />
<br />
Server Settings<br />
The server must be running the latest official version of ET:QW with no mods.<br />
Punkbuster must be enabled <br />
<br />
Rosters<br />
Matches will be played 4 vs 4. In order for a match to be played 3 eligible players must be present AND ready to play no later than 20 minutes after the scheduled match time. If a team is unable to meet these requirements they will be forced to forfeit the match. <br />
<br />
Only players that are registered on the playing team's roster are eligible. New players and team members are eligible for match play if they are registered on a team's roster no later than 24 hours before match time. Teams in Quake Wars league are not allowed to use ringers or players not on their roster. <br />
<br />
Quake Wars League players are only allowed to play for one team in the League. Any player who is caught playing for two teams or ringing will be suspended from the league for a minimum of 14 days. In addition the teams with the double registered player will be subject to having match overturns at the staff's discretion.<br />
Team Captains are responsible for maintaining their team's roster and making sure that their players are eligible for play. Teams found using ineligible players may be subject to suspension, expulsion or loss of points. The severity of the punishment is the decision of the QWL staff. <br />
<br />
<br />
Server Usage<br />
Servers will be agreed upon or as directed by a ref/admin.<br />
This is an European Ladder so servers must be located in Europe. Non European clans are welcome to join this ladder but must agree to play on a Euro server when playing against an European team.<br />
<br />
<br />
Substitutions and Spectators<br />
Teams may substitute players at any time during the round if the number of players drops below 4 (3 if only 3 players were present at the start of the match). An appropriate time for a substitution to take place is during a timeout or in between rounds.<br />
<br />
IRC<br />
It is encouraged that all teams use IRC to facilitate planning, matches, and admin contact. The QWL irc channel can be found in Quakenet #QWL.<br />
<br />
Rescheduling:<br />
A match or round may be rescheduled to a different time or date if both parties agree. An admin must also be contacted in advanced. Otherwise default times are required by League rules. <br />
<br />
Match Results<br />
Match results are to be reported as soon as the match is completed. Disputes may be filed even after the match has been reported, because of this, it is required that all players record demos and take screenshots in case of a match dispute. These demos must be kept on hand and readily available for at least 2 weeks after the match has been played, as they must be submitted to QWL staff upon request. Failure to meet these requirements may result in disciplinary actions to take place.<br />
<br />
Sportsmanship and Cheating<br />
Unsportsmanlike and cheating will not be tolerated by the QWL. This policy applies at all times when conducting Quake Wars League related business; not just during a match. The use of exploits, cursing, insults, or racial slurs will result in a forfeit loss and possible suspension or removal from the league. <br />
<br />
If a player or team believes that a player from the opposing team has used a hack or exploit during the match an admin should be notified and demos should be submitted immediately. In addition, demos from and information from all members of the opposing team is required when a hack accusation takes place. Failure to do so will result in negative consequences. <br />
<br />
If a team indeed has a player who has utilized a hack or exploit they will be permanetly banned from QWL and all matches that the player has participated in will be overturned. Negative repercussions may occur for the accused team; however this is at the admins discretion. <br />
<br />
Procedures for reporting a hack<br />
Contact a ref or admin in the QWL irc channel <br />
<br />
General Rules<br />
<br />
Inactivity: if for any reason a team must be inactive for an extended period of time it is recommended that they drop from the current league. A team may remain in the league however they will receive forfeit losses; this may result in the suspension of the team, however.<br />
<br />
Roster Management: <br />
Each team is required to meet the minimum amount of players necessary for competition before rosters are locked. Captains and managers are responsible for maintaining a roster that contains only eligible players (as defined earlier). Failure to do so may lead to negative repercussions.<br />
<br />
It is the responsibility of each team (both home and away) to check the eligibility and validity of each player on the opposing team rosters. Because of this it is recommended to have the necessary information readily available to check prior to match time. If a team finds an ineligible player it is the responsibility of the opponent to refuse this player and notify an admin. <br />
<br />
Server Crash: <br />
In the event of a server crash both teams must agree on the remaining time and score prior to the crash. If an agreement on the score and time remaining cannot be achieve then the whole map may be restarted. <br />
<br />
Punctuality: <br />
Teams are expected to be on a server and ready to play with the minimum number of players (3) at the agreed upon time. Any team that is unable to meet these requirements or who is more than 20 minutes tardy for the match will be penalized with a forfeit. <br />
<br />
Sportsmanship, cheating, ringing, and double clanning policy as defined earlier applies to all Quake Wars league affairs. QWL has a ZERO tolerance policy regarding such matters.		</td>
