			Not invented by ESL but initated by Clan Kompaniet and with the help of a handful of high ranked clans the new rule set is just announced.<br />
<br />
Although I agree there need to be restrictions to keep the game playable in a 6 vs 6 Stopwatch match I feel they have gone to far.<br />
<br />
Rules like: only one turret per class/side, no heavy vehicles at last stage are really over the top if you ask me.<br />
<br />
Are these rules really agreed to the community or just a handful of top level clans?<br />
Please let us know and vote on the poll in the right menu. Please be aware itâ€™s not our intention to break the community. We just want to know how the community really feels.<br />

		I find them too restrictive aswell. <br />
<br />
IMHO:<br />
<br />
&quot;- Only allowed to use heavy and medium vehicles from the default or nearest possible spawn .&quot;<br />
The attacking team should also be allowed to take vehicles from the previous spawns.<br />
<br />
&quot;- No heavy vehicles allowed on the last objective.&quot;<br />
Get rid of this.<br />
<br />
&quot;- MAX 1 deployable per class and type.&quot;<br />
Just max. 1 deployable per type would be better, meaning that there could be an AIT, AVT and APT simultaneously.<br />
<br />
&quot;- NO aircrafts. &quot;<br />
If allowed, they could bring a fresh air to the matches, but I understand why some people don't want it. Not the most important rule to change.	</td>

		They are too restrictive, and some are just outright non-enforcable. <br />
<br />
They talk about these rules being required until a mod comes out; well i'd rather a competitive mod was created over months of close critisism over competitive games using stock gameplay. Rules like this did not appear when W:ET came onto the scene. If they had done, ETPro would have been a very, very different mod.	</td>

		To remind you of the QWL rules:<br />
<br />
- Teams may only use vehicles from their current spawn and/or capturable forward spawns.<br />
The defending team may use vehicles from the previous spawn (meaning they don't have to abandon their current vehicle when they loose a spawn point) if it does not conflict with the vehicle restriction ruleset<br />
- Teams may only use 1 heavy vehicle at a time.<br />
- Teams may only use 1 medium vehicle at a time.<br />
- Teams may only use 1 sniper, however there is no limit on the Covert Ops/Infiltrator class.<br />
- There may only be 1 Field Ops/Opressor deployable, however there is no limit on the Field Ops/Opressor class.<br />
- Flying vehicles are not allowed. (Not including the Icarus)<br />
<br />
Heavy vehicles include: Cyclops, Desecrator and Titan.<br />
Medium vehicles include: Hog and APC.<br />
<br />
These rules are already hard to understand and restrictive for starting clans. Don't make them more complicated!	</td>

		Those rules are absolutely and completely ridiculous! Ok, maybe one of them is quite good - that one about spawn-points and vehicles but... Until it is NOT FORCED BY GAME ITSELF it is still ridiculous. And that's probably not only my opinion in this case. So the question remains: what we supposed to do with that? I'll tell you what I think we supposed to do. We supposed to enforce changes on ESL, CB etc. admins and supervisors by some kind of poll or something. If majority of clans will decide that they don't want even hear about those boundaries they will have no choice like just  trash'em. And then if someone don't want to see any of flyers, tanks, turrests etc. can join infantry-only ladder for example. I hope that I'm not alone in fight against cutting this game's balls off.  <img src="http://www.quakewarsleague.com/html/images/smilies/frown.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" />	</td>

I do agree on certain rules set for a map like Valley or Sewer, but to use these particular rules on all maps (well, they ones they picked anyway) ..........<br />
<br />
I still think the game should be played as intended; again agree on the fact that 6v6 competition needs certain rules, but overall: removing everything looks more like destroying a game rather than improving it.	</td>

		The problem is, that &quot;high&quot; skilled clans want these rules, and when I tried to conversate about them on irc channel, all I got back was mocking. &quot;learn to play so u understand the rules&quot; was common answer, when they couldnt even base arguments behind their rules. The quakewars should be played as quakewars, not as something infantry skills based game. If you want to play only inf you can go back to your old game or visit CS.<br />
<br />
Certain restrictions are ofc needed, like for plasma mortar. I dont see limit of engi turrets required, when team decides to take many engineers, they have less medics, airstrikes and so on.<br />
<br />
Fliers should be allowed, making the game even faster and adding more depth and possibilites to tactics.	</td>

		Agree with new rules.<br />
Vehicles are still there, but limited. This is good, same limitation were in qwl league. <br />
Fliers, i think is better not allowing them. Too powerfuls in expert hands.<br />
And Turrets limitation. Its great. I explain. With turrets in defense you have x+3 players in match, you dont have to worry cause you know they win game. With limited turrets, you will need your mates to make a defend, you ll have to sacrifice to have a turret repaired, and skills of everyone will be tested.<br />
<br />
Think about this, if you limit vehicles (good) , youll have to limit avt turrets, right?<br />
<br />
Limited vehicles in GDF side, for same reasons before, i see it good.<br />
About last objective rule, is the only one i disagree...	</td>

		Personally, I think that &quot;high-skilled&quot; (as you called them) clans are afraid of something. What it is? Maybe that some &quot;lower-skilled&quot; (sic!) clans could beat them with tactic which couldn't been beaten by shooting-skill only?<br />
I'm not sure about this but who knows... What I'm sure about is that some of them regret that QW is not exactly like classic ET. But they need to realize that whole bunch of clans would like to play it &quot;as it is&quot;. Who gave them law to decide about what is allowed and what is restricted? Why should we restrict anything (except cheating of course) while game's life had just begun? Four years guys form Splash Damage were working on balance this game in every asspect. So who is that smartass who thinks that game is not balanced after few days of playing in retail game (which is a bit different from demo and betas) and says &quot;I'm sure that with this rules it will be more balanced&quot;? Hmm? Maybe it would be better to wait until more clans get involved in the game and then decide what supposed to be restricted and what not? I repeat once again: it is decission of all clans - not only those few who used to be called &quot;high-skilled&quot;.	</td>

		remember that the game was balanced for a 12v12 or more pub play, not 6on6 pcw. Vehicles restrictions are a must, however not by a type but by quantity. I truly hope that with SDK released there will be a mod created with longer vehicle and deployable spawns, thus not restricting them at all would be possible.	</td>

I mean the old rules of i3d and qwl are big and great rules so far...Like i said.. u can use them for all maps.. we tested it today in 1 pracc and it worked fine for us <img src="http://www.quakewarsleague.com/html/images/smilies/wink.gif" alt=";)" title=";)" /><br />
<br />
So i cant understand why we have to change them...<br />
<br />
Well never mind.. im against the new rules and im in for the old QWL rules maybe with 1-2 rule updates (not with 1 turret only.. this is senseless..)<br />
<br />
greetings..<br />

		ok this rules are lame, ok for the heavy vehicels are ok, the class limit is 50/50. The number of deployabels is just lame same with the map list.<br />
So just stick to i3D/QWL ruels! Make a PAM modd, where we cot configs for the bigest leagues and then pack them in to one modd, so we just can typ a cvar i console and boom I3d ruels are loaded or boom QWL ruels is running on the server! <br />

		Why so much restrictions? There are only 6 people per side and some of them have to fullfill objectives. If a team wants to have 6 Dark Matter Cannons, let them have them. Sooner or later they will see for themselves that Quake Wars requires a good mix of classes and a good strategy. I don't really see a reason why Flyers are restricted. Certainly a good pilot can help his team a lot, but most times one rocket is enough to take him down to the bottom. <br />
<br />
I thought that the old ruleset was balanced for Valley only and hoped to see some lesser restrictions for the full game. I hope we can enjoy the full spectrum of the game like it was at the QuakeCon tournament.	</td>

I dont find 3/4 man of a 6 man team in a vehicle and exessive deploy spam fun so i voted for these rules. After playing them for some 20 pcws now they seem to work. The indoor vehicle rule is bad and is already removed.	</td>

That would make the fliers useless. You cant dodge rockets without counter-measures, no matter your flying skill. The only chance of survival you got is that the rocket will hit an obstacle / like a tree or a building. One determined rocket soldier can easily lock on a flyer in less than 4 seconds, and that is the end of that. Lets w8 for the stopwatch mode SD will hopefuly release. Boosting flyers spawn time to sth as insane as 1:30 or even 2 min would make it possible to use them while still holding the balance.	</td>

		I like QWL's approach of at least letting the public have a say in the matter and asking what we the average player thinks of the rules to be used.<br />
<br />
With beta 1 and 2 it became quickly apparent that we do indeed need restrictions and although we can't properly enforce them yet that's not to say we shouldn't just leave everything in for now. Some basic restrictions as suggested already by QWL seem adequate enough for me, we shouldn't assume too much at this early stage and try to impose such ridiculous restrictions as proposed by  the 'Community' Ruleset. <br />
<br />
In time, whether it be through the promised stopwatch support from SD or through a modification we will be able to properly enforce restrictions then and only then should we be considering a heavy handed approach to restrictions but only based on the findings of using a relaxed rule set that we should use up until that time. <br />
<br />
Another thing is that say if we find that a heavy vehicle proves to be too dominating, should we remove this vehicle or rather suggest ways to alter the said vehicle to lessen it's influence? I think the latter approach would be best in my opinion.	</td>
